# Maze Solver
# Project 3 COT4400 by Aidan Khalil

## Description
This program solves maze problems represented by arrows with directions and colors using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. It reads the maze from an input file, finds the travel path from the starting arrow to the bullseye, and outputs the solution path string to an output file.

## Compilation

### Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

### Commands
g++ .\main.cpp -o maze_solver
.\maze_solver.exe

OR

g++ .\main.cpp
.\a.exe

Ensuring the input file is in same directory as main.cpp, an output.txt file will be produced in said directory with the "Apollo and Diana maze travel path" for the given maze!
